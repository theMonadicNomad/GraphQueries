# GraphQueries

Implementing GraphQueries in Haskell using Reachability Queries. The Graph Queries are implemeted on top of [Daison (DAta lISt comprehensiON)](https://github.com/krangelov/daison/) 

1. Reachability Queries for Acyclic graphs using AILabel Approach based on AILabel approach (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-25255-1_46)
2. Reachability Queries for Cyclic Graphs by converting into Acyclic Graphs using Tarjans Algorithm and then implementing AILabel algorithm.
